# Title: DEK

## User Story

'DEK' is an app which allows users to create their own unique stack of flash cards to aid in the learning process. This app can be used to learn a new language (foreign or programming) or any new subject which requires memorization.

When a new user visits the app, the first screen is a Welcome screen where the user can register to create a unique login. A registered user can simply login.

After loggging in, the user will be directed to the main menu. At the main menus, the user canchoose to create a new flash card, review all flash cards, or review just the hard flash card - which the user got wrong previously. The user will also see a grand total score for how many cards the user got right during the user's flash card reviews.

A new user would want to begin by creating several flash cards. A button on the main menu would direc the user to a form where the create can create a front side (with a question or word) and a back side for each flash card. 

When the user is reviewing flash cards, the user will view the front side of a flash card. When the user is ready, the user can click to view other side and check whether the user was right or wrong. The user clicks on 'right' or 'wrong' buttons to record whether the user got it right. If the card is 'wrong', that information is saved in the database and the card will be re-reviewed in the difficult set of cards. A card that is right would only be reviewed in a full review of all cards.

Cards can also be deleted, or edited and updated.
